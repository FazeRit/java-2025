<h1>Dmytro</h1>
<p>
    I am a dedicated student at the Faculty of Informatics and Computer Science (FIOT)<br>
    at the National Technical University of Ukraine, Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute<br>
    (KPI). I approach my studies with diligence and persistence, always striving to deepen my<br>
    knowledge and improve my skills. My hard skills include proficiency in Java programming, <br>
    a solid understanding of Spring and Spring Boot frameworks, and the ability to design and develop<br>
    robust applications. Alongside technical expertise, I value soft skills such as responsibility,<br>
    adaptability, teamwork, problem-solving, and strong communication, which help me collaborate <br>
    effectively and grow as a professional.
